🧠 CodeCortex: The Second Brain for Your C# Codebase.
Lost in the labyrinth of spaghetti code? Tired of "Find All References" not telling you the why?

Forget CTRL+F. It’s time to stop just searching and start understanding your code.

Introducing CodeCortex – the next-generation Code Intelligence engine built specifically for the .NET ecosystem. It’s not just a search tool; it’s a cognitive layer over your entire Solution.

🚀 Why CodeCortex?
Modern software development is too complex for single-purpose tools. That’s why CodeCortex leverages a revolutionary Tri-brid Architecture to visualize your project in three dimensions:

🔍 Lexical Precision (Lucene): Pinpoint every variable, error code, and typo with surgical accuracy. Zero ambiguity.

💡 Semantic Understanding (Vector AI): Ask in plain English! "Where is the authentication logic?" or "How do we handle retry policies?". CodeCortex understands your intent, not just your keywords.

🕸️ Structural Depth (Graph): See the invisible! Our Neo4j-powered graph engine maps call chains and dependencies. "If I change this, what breaks 5 levels up?" – CodeCortex knows the answer.

⚡ Powered by .NET 10 & Aspire
Built on the technology of tomorrow. CodeCortex runs on the bleeding-edge .NET 10 , with .NET Aspire orchestrating cloud-native containers. Blazing fast, scalable, and brutally modern.

Don't just write code. Master the chaos.
